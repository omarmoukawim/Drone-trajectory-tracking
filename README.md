The goal of this project was to successfully control the trajectory of a Crazyflie 2.X drone
from a target PC exploiting data from the Motion Capture system (MoCap) that is streamed by
another PC; four infrared cameras were available for the tracking.The use of data from the drone expansion deck combined with the real-time measurements from the MoCap system allowed the
drone to follow a target trajectory starting at any given point in the range of view of the Optitrack
cameras.
